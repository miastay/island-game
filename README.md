# island-game
Test game in Java to examine optimization strategies for graphics &amp; game logic

This project was intended as an opportunity to examine the use of different data structures in Java for the purpose of building and optimizing a game engine from scratch.
Examples of this include:
    Abstract lists, ArrayLists defined by interface generics, hashtables with nested list types.
    Use of Swing & AWT libraries to investigate graphics optimization under an otherwise bulky framework.
    File manipulation and data abstraction in different scopes.
    Game logic multithreading.
    And graphics layering / rendering overrides to improve performance.
